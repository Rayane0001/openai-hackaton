## ✨ Revolutionary Concept

Instead of asking an AI what to do, you **chat with future versions of yourself** who lived through the consequences:

- **🌟 The Visionary** - "Everything worked out perfectly!"
- **⚖️ The Balanced** - "Here's what actually happened..."  
- **🛡️ The Sage** - "I'm glad I played it safe"
- **🚀 The Explorer** - "I took the leap and it paid off!"
